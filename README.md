# Application-Tracking-Prediction

This repository contains the code base for running machine learning models on the Graduate Admission dataset. I have 
created an algorithm to group similar applicants using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering on this dataset for exploratory data analysis.

Following this, several machine learning models were tried and ultimately, I achieved an accuracy of 85% using XGBoost model
